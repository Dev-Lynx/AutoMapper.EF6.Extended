# AutoMapper.EF6.Extended


### Purpose

AutoMapper and it's related AutoMapper.EF6 projects are great projects.

This project's aim is to extend the capability for **EF6** usage only, hopefully creating additional functionality via Extension methods without impacting AutoMapper (Core).

### Backlog

* Support `object` parameters in AutoMapper `ProjectTo` calls (see [Parameterization](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki/Queryable-Extensions#parameterization))
* Support Post Projection Transforms after Async calls
* Support Post Projection Transforms in Async calls
